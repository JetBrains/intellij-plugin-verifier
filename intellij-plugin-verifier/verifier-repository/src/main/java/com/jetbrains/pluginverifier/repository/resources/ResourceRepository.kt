/**
 * Resource repository is a data structure that maintains
 * a set of _resources_ identified by unique [keys].
 *
 * The essential difference from the standard cache, such as
 * one provided by [guava cache] [com.google.common.cache.LoadingCache],
 * is that for all the keys being [fetched] [get] the [resource lock] [ResourceLock]
 * is registered. This resource lock, until being [released] [ResourceLock.release],
 * protects the key from [removing] [remove] by other threads.
 *
 * This useful protection property is intended for the cases in which
 * several concurrent threads access the same shareable resource, such as
 * a file, and it is necessary to ensure that no thread will remove the file
 * while it is used by any other thread. Once the file becomes unused, it can be
 * safely removed.
 *
 * The main [implementation] [ResourceRepositoryImpl], in addition to that properties,
 * provides means to limit the total "weight" of the resources being kept.
 * In the above example with files, this can be used to set up the maximum disk space
 * used by all the available files. Once the space exceeds the limit, the unused files
 * become evicted. The files for eviction are chosen using a configurable [policy] [EvictionPolicy].
